## Overview

FusionCore Apps ("we", "our") builds mobile applications and this website. This policy explains how we handle data across our apps and site.

## Data We Collect

- **App analytics** (crash reports, usage events) to improve stability and features.  
- **Advertising identifiers** when an app uses ads (e.g., Google AdMob).  
- **Push tokens** only if you opt in to notifications.  
- **Support email** when you contact us.

We do **not** sell personal data.

## How We Use Data

- Provide and improve features.  
- Diagnose and fix crashes.  
- Personalize content like daily verses.  
- Show non‑intrusive ads in free apps.

## Third‑Party Services

Our apps may integrate Google Play Services, Google AdMob, and analytics. Their data practices are governed by their own policies.

## Children's Privacy

Our apps are **not** directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided data, contact us and we will delete it.

## Your Choices

- Disable analytics or ads personalization in device settings where available.  
- Opt out of notifications in the app or device settings.
